# Digital Multi-Access Key

Species identification key which enables the user to freely choose the characteristics of a species that are convenient to evaluate for recognition.

## Prolog

Prolog is a logic programming language (PROgramming in LOgic) associated with artificial intelligence and computational logistics. It is significantly different from conventional procedural programming. Essentially, logical relationships are asserted and Prolog is used to determine whether certain statements are true, and if true, what variable bindings make them true.

Prolog is an ideal language for this project because of the fact that species traits can be logically linked by implications. This enables a digital multi-access key to have more flexibility in drawing conclusions from the information given by the user.
